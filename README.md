## Overview
‘Back to school’ is a fun interactive quiz targeted specifically at primary KS2 students. The website aims to offer a simple but fun way for students from year 3 - 6 to test their subject knowledge against questions that are linked to the KS2 primary national curriculum. Students spend on average **** a day on phones and tablets. Therefore, providing a simple easy access quiz that tests and boosts student’s knowledge can supplement their screen time with an educational, yet fun benefit. 

## Aims
The aim of this website is to provide an easy to access, fun, interactive quiz for primary school ks2 students. Questions are based on the KS2 curriculum therefore are accessible for students. User’s scores are displayed so users can try to compete against their own score, answering more correct questions and therefore developing their subject knowledge.

## Target Audience
The primary target audience for the site is ks2 children who want a fun way to revise and test their knowledge. A secondary target audience is parents of students who would like to engage with their child’s learning. As well as teacher who would like to audit their subject knowledge.

## User Expectations

As the primary target audience for the site is children, for this website the following user expectations were considered when creating the site:
* Easy to access, simple and clear
* Responsive as students will be accessing on multiple devices
* Questions in quiz should be relevant to the national curriculum 
* Dynamic real-time feedback should be presented to users so they are aware of correct and incorrect answers

## Colour schemes 

A warm, bright UI was chosen for the colour scheme of this website. As the primary target audience is children between 7 - 12, bright attractive colours were utilised to gain the attention of the user as well as present a warm and friendly application. A white ‘gamebox’ was used in order for the users to easily see the questions and there is adequate contrast between colours. Imagecolourpicker.com was used in order to select the colours from the background image to keep colour consistency throughout the site. rgba(255,208,224,255), a shade of pink, was used for buttons and answer boxes. To stand out, the footer is in black and the icons are in the colour rgba(255,208,224,255). When the icons are hovered over, the colour scheme shifts to rgba(111,216,187,255). This colour was also taken from the background image using Imagecolourpicker.com 

## Fonts

‘Indie flower’ was used as the primary font for this website. As this website is aimed for primary school students, I wanted a font that emulated handwriting as students at this age handwrite the majority of their work. Having a handwriting styled font would add a layer of familiarity to the website. Indie flower was also chosen as comparatively to other handwritten styled fonts, as it appeared more legible and readable. I chose to use ‘Indie flower’ for both the h tags and the p tags as I wanted the consistency of the handwritten theme throughout the website and having two separate styled handwritten themes appeared incongruent. ‘san-serif’ was chosen as a backup font for the site should indie flower fail to load.
